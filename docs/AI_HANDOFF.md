# AI Handoff

## Current goal
Add owner-only trash/restore support for deleted public pages without changing support forms, Google Sheets flow, or existing admin session behavior.

## Update 2026-05-15 (owner deleted public pages trash/restore)

### Changed files
- `supabase/migrations/202605150001_public_pages_deleted.sql`
- `src/lib/server/public-pages-store.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/deleted-public-pages/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/deleted-public-pages/[id]/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/deleted-public-pages/[id]/restore/route.ts`
- `src/components/admin/owner-control-client.tsx`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Schema/migration
- Added `public.public_pages_deleted` archive table with `id`, `slug`, `data`, previous owner, original update time, deleted time, deleting admin, reason, FK constraints, and indexes for owner, deleted date, and slug.

### Behavior change
- `DELETE /api/public-pages/[slug]` now archives the full active row to `public_pages_deleted` before deleting from `public_pages`.
- Archive insert errors are not swallowed; the API returns failure and does not report successful deletion if archive insertion fails.
- Public route reads remain scoped to `public_pages`, so deleted pages do not render publicly.
- `/api/me/public-pages` and My Pages continue to list active `public_pages` only.
- Added owner-only deleted-pages APIs:
  - `GET /api/admin/deleted-public-pages`
  - `POST /api/admin/deleted-public-pages/[id]/restore`
  - `DELETE /api/admin/deleted-public-pages/[id]`
- Restore checks active slug conflicts before inserting. Existing active slug returns 409 with a restore-as-new-slug message.
- Owner can restore archived pages to the original slug, restore as a new slug, and assign the restored page to an active admin.
- Owner Control now shows active slug count and deleted slug count separately, plus a `Deleted Pages` table with restore, restore-as-new-slug, assign, and delete-forever actions.
- Delete forever UI requires typing `DELETE {slug}`.

### Scope/guardrails preserved
- Support form logic unchanged.
- Google Sheets logic unchanged.
- Existing admin session/auth logic unchanged except owner checks on new owner-only APIs.
- Save Now PUT flow unchanged.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS

## Update 2026-05-15 (Admin My Pages response/render fix)

### Changed files
- `src/components/admin/admin-shell.tsx`
- `src/lib/public-pages/public-pages-client.ts`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Root cause addressed
- `AdminShell` kept the initial My Pages load effect dependent on callbacks that changed when translation/session-related state updated. The effect cleanup aborted the active `/api/me/public-pages` request before it could populate `savedProfiles`, leaving My Pages at `Owner view: 0 visible slug` even though the API returned pages.
- The public-pages client already targeted `/api/me/public-pages`, but malformed 200 responses were silently treated as an empty list. It now requires the authenticated response shape `{ pages: [...], viewer: {...} }` and reads `response.pages`.

### Behavior change
- My Pages list refresh callbacks now use a stable translation ref for messages, so normal render/session updates do not recreate the active list-loading effect.
- The active My Pages list request is aborted only by `AdminShell` cleanup, such as component unmount or route change.
- Storage-warning event wiring is split out from the initial data-load effect so warning text changes cannot abort list loading.
- Save Now PUT flow remains unchanged: one immediate `PUT /api/public-pages/[slug]` per click, followed by the existing list/admin context refresh on success.

### Validation
- `listPublicPages()` expects `{ pages: PublicPageListResponseItem[], viewer?: AdminViewer }` and maps `payload.pages` into saved profiles.
- Owner visible slug count is still derived from `savedProfiles.length`, which is now populated from `response.pages`.
- `npm run lint`: PASS
- `npm run build`: PASS

## Update 2026-05-15 (admin public-pages request storm fix)

### Changed files
- `src/components/admin/admin-shell.tsx`
- `src/lib/public-pages/public-pages-client.ts`
- `src/app/api/public-pages/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/me/public-pages/route.ts`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Root cause addressed
- `AdminShell` refreshed My Pages from storage events and a polling interval while the initial load effect could also rerun after admin session state changed.
- Save success dispatched a storage event and separately refreshed My Pages, so list fetches could stack up before the PUT save completed.

### Behavior change
- My Pages now fetches from `/api/me/public-pages` once after the admin session is confirmed.
- The shared My Pages refresh has a single-flight guard plus an abort controller for unmount cleanup.
- Save Now bypasses the autosave debounce and starts one immediate `PUT /api/public-pages/[slug]` per click.
- After a successful PUT, the admin list refreshes once and admin context refreshes separately for quota/account state.
- Client public-pages requests now use a timeout so loading/saving state can leave pending UI via existing `catch`/`finally` paths.
- `/api/me/public-pages` reuses the authenticated public-pages list handler, returning JSON 200, 401, or 500 responses.

### Scope/guardrails preserved
- Supabase public page persistence remains in `public_pages`.
- Support form logic unchanged.
- Google Sheets flow unchanged.
- `/admin` route unchanged.
- Root `/` redirect behavior unchanged.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS

## Update 2026-04-21 (mobile social/embed UI polish + social icon image URL)

### Changed files
- `src/features/builder/types.ts`
- `src/features/builder/schema.ts`
- `src/components/admin/sections/social-icons-section.tsx`
- `src/components/preview/mobile-preview.tsx`
- `src/lib/local-storage/profile-storage.ts`
- `src/lib/local-storage/image-storage.ts`
- `src/i18n/en.ts`
- `src/i18n/th.ts`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Added `social.iconImageUrl` as a URL-only social icon override.
- Social icon render priority is now:
  - `iconImageUrl`
  - existing uploaded `iconUrl`
  - default provider icon
- Social icon rendering now uses fixed-size wrappers and `object-contain` to avoid oversized or cropped icon images.
- Mobile embed modal actions now use smaller mobile sizing (`h-11`, `text-sm`) while preserving larger desktop sizing.
- Embed modal container now supports touch scrolling with `max-h-[80dvh]`, `overflow-y-auto`, `overscroll-contain`, and `touch-pan-y`.
- Embed modal spacing was tightened on mobile.

### Scope/guardrails preserved
- Save/load/Supabase logic unchanged.
- Support form logic unchanged.
- Google Sheets flow unchanged.
- `/admin` route unchanged.
- Public behavior unchanged except social/embed UI rendering improvements.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

## Update 2026-04-21 (editor My Pages/Load source-of-truth aligned to Supabase)

### Changed files
- `src/components/admin/admin-shell.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/admin-sidebar.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/saved-profiles-manager-card.tsx`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- `AdminShell` now owns the authoritative My Pages list fetched from Supabase (`/api/public-pages`) and passes that list down to sidebar/cards.
- `SavedProfilesManagerCard` now consumes the shared Supabase list from `AdminShell` instead of relying on local component-local source state.
- Initial editor hydration now resolves slug in this order:
  - local active slug only if it exists in current Supabase page list
  - otherwise first available Supabase page slug
  - otherwise current workspace fallback slug
- `Load` continues to call `onSwitchWorkspace`, which fetches selected slug from Supabase via `getPublicPageBySlug` and hydrates editor state.
- `Save now` / autosave publishing path remains unchanged and still writes through `upsertPublicPageBySlug` to Supabase.

### Scope/guardrails preserved
- Support form logic unchanged.
- Google Sheets support-submission flow unchanged.
- Root `/` redirect behavior unchanged (`/` -> `/110`).
- `/admin` remains editor route.
- Reset/restore local backup behavior in Data Tools remains local-only as intentional backup UX; it is not the source of truth for My Pages or Load.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

## Update 2026-04-20 (bucket mismatch hardening for deposit slip uploads)

### Changed files
- `src/app/api/support/deposit-issues/route.ts`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Root cause addressed
- `POST /api/support/deposit-issues` was using fallback bucket name `support-uploads` when `SUPPORT_UPLOADS_BUCKET` was missing.
- On production, this can point to a non-existent bucket and fail with `StorageApiError: Bucket not found`.

### Behavior change
- Removed hardcoded/fallback bucket resolution in deposit upload route.
- Bucket is now **explicitly required** from `SUPPORT_UPLOADS_BUCKET`.
- Added defensive runtime logging of bucket source/value for each request:
  - route-level runtime bucket log
  - storage config presence flags
- If `SUPPORT_UPLOADS_BUCKET` is missing, route now returns a clear server error:
  - `Server misconfiguration: SUPPORT_UPLOADS_BUCKET is not set.`
- If Supabase URL/service-role key is missing, route now returns:
  - `Server misconfiguration: Supabase storage credentials are missing.`
- Support submit flow contract is otherwise unchanged:
  - still uploads slip to Supabase Storage
  - still forwards `slipUrl` into existing `submitDepositIssue` flow
  - Google Sheets mapping/flow unchanged

### Env setup
- `SUPPORT_UPLOADS_BUCKET` must match an existing bucket in the target Supabase project.
- `.env.example` updated to require explicit value (no default fallback).

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

## Update 2026-04-20 (deposit slip upload: direct Supabase Storage, no local FS writes)

### Changed files
- `src/app/api/support/deposit-issues/route.ts`
- `src/lib/server/support-submissions-store.ts`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- `POST /api/support/deposit-issues` no longer writes uploaded slip images to local filesystem paths (`/var/task`, `process.cwd()`, `data/...`).
- Deposit slip file is uploaded directly to Supabase Storage using server-side Supabase admin credentials (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`).
- Route now passes a real Supabase Storage URL (`slipUrl`) into `submitDepositIssue`, preserving existing Google Sheets row mapping.
- Added explicit runtime logs for:
  - route hit
  - `formData` keys
  - file metadata (name/type/size)
  - storage upload success/failure
  - final image URL
- Removed unused local support-upload path helper from `support-submissions-store` to avoid accidental local image persistence path reuse.
- Client-side preview flow remains unchanged (preview still uses selected file before submit).

### Env setup
- Added:
  - `SUPPORT_UPLOADS_BUCKET=support-uploads`
- Required for server-side upload:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### Notes
- The configured `SUPPORT_UPLOADS_BUCKET` should be a public bucket if slip URLs need to be directly viewable from any device without signed URL exchange.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

## Last completed
- Added submission adapter layer:
  - `SUPPORT_SUBMISSION_ADAPTER_MODE=auto|local_dev|google_sheets`
  - Google Sheets adapter selected by env configuration
  - local-dev JSON store remains fallback in development
- Kept existing support endpoints and client UX unchanged:
  - `POST /api/support/deposit-issues`
  - `POST /api/support/withdraw-issues`
- Added Google Sheets row writing with service-account JWT auth.
- Added dedicated sheet/tab target support:
  - deposit tab (default: `ฝากเงินไม่เข้า`)
  - withdraw tab (default: `ถอนเงินไม่ได้`)
- Added server route for uploaded slip file references:
  - `GET /api/support/uploads/[kind]/[file]`
  - deposit submissions now store usable `slip_url` references for sheet rows.

## Changed files
- `.env.example`
- `src/lib/server/support-submission-adapter.ts`
- `src/lib/server/support-submissions-store.ts`
- `src/lib/server/support-submissions-store.ts`
- `src/app/api/support/deposit-issues/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/support/withdraw-issues/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/support/uploads/[kind]/[file]/route.ts`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

## Behavior change
- Support submissions can now be routed to Google Sheets in production without changing endpoint or UI flow.
- Local dev file storage remains available as fallback/development target.
- Deposit sheet rows include: `submitted_at, issue_type, user, registered_phone, slip_url, transaction_time, note, status`.
- Withdraw sheet rows include: `submitted_at, issue_type, user, phone, full_name, bank_account, transaction_time, note, status`.

## Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

## Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (required escalated run due sandbox `spawn EPERM` on non-escalated execution)

## Known issues
- In this environment, non-escalated production build may fail with `spawn EPERM`; escalated build succeeds.
- Local-dev storage still writes to:
  - `data/support-submissions.dev.json`
  - `data/support-uploads/...`
- For Google Sheets mode, target tabs must already exist in the spreadsheet and match env tab names.
- Uploaded slip URLs use local app host path (`/api/support/uploads/...`), so external readers need network access to this app host.

## Google Sheets setup
1. Create one Google Sheet and two tabs:
   - `ฝากเงินไม่เข้า`
   - `ถอนเงินไม่ได้`
2. Add header columns exactly:
   - Deposit tab:
     - `submitted_at, issue_type, user, registered_phone, slip_url, transaction_time, note, status`
   - Withdraw tab:
     - `submitted_at, issue_type, user, phone, full_name, bank_account, transaction_time, note, status`
3. Create a Google service account and share the sheet with service account email (Editor).
4. Configure env:
   - `SUPPORT_SUBMISSION_ADAPTER_MODE=google_sheets` (or `auto`)
   - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SUPPORT_SPREADSHEET_ID=<sheet-id>`
   - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SUPPORT_DEPOSIT_TAB=ฝากเงินไม่เข้า`
   - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SUPPORT_WITHDRAW_TAB=ถอนเงินไม่ได้`
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=<service-account-email>`
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=<private-key-with-\\n>`
5. Mode behavior:
   - `auto`: uses Google when configured, otherwise local dev store.
   - `local_dev`: always local JSON/file store.
   - `google_sheets`: requires valid config; in development, missing config falls back to local with warning.

## Next recommended step
1. Add rate limiting and bot/abuse checks on support submit routes.
2. Add a secure signed URL / private object storage strategy for slip files in production.
3. Add lightweight submission monitoring/alerting for failed Google Sheets writes.

## Update 2026-04-18 (deposit_issue submit flow)

### Changed files
- `src/components/preview/mobile-preview.tsx`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Fixed `deposit_issue` validation flow so `file_image` required checks now validate against selected file state (`formFilesByLink`) before generic text/choice required checks.
- This unblocks form submit when slip preview is visible and allows the existing submit branch to run:
  - append selected file to `FormData` as `slip`
  - call `POST /api/support/deposit-issues`
- Preserved existing image-only validation and 5MB max-size validation.
- No changes made to `withdraw_issue`, save/reset/restore, autosave, Google Sheets adapter, or success/error modal behavior.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

### Known issues
- In this environment, non-escalated production build can fail with `spawn EPERM`; escalated build succeeds.
- No additional deposit/withdraw flow regressions identified in static checks, but end-to-end browser interaction was not executed in this terminal-only run.

## Update 2026-04-18 (deposit_issue server parse fix)

### Changed files
- `src/app/api/support/deposit-issues/route.ts`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Removed `safeJsonParse` import from `deposit-issues` route because that utility is client-only (`"use client"`).
- Added a server-safe inline JSON helper (`parseJsonWithFallback`) and switched `responses` parsing to use it.
- Preserved existing `FormData` flow, `slip` file validation, upload write, `submitDepositIssue` call, and response shape.
- No changes made to UI, `withdraw_issue`, save/reset/restore, autosave, or Google Sheets adapter logic.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

### Known issues
- In this environment, non-escalated production build can fail with `spawn EPERM`; escalated build succeeds.
- End-to-end browser submission was not executed in this terminal-only run.

## Update 2026-04-18 (production root route safety default)

### Changed files
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Root route `/` no longer renders `AdminShell`.
- Root route now redirects to `/110` as a temporary production-safe default.
- Public slug routes such as `/<username>` remain unchanged (including `/110`).
- No changes made to support form logic, save/reset/restore behavior, autosave, or Google Sheets adapter.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

### Known issues
- In this environment, non-escalated production build can fail with `spawn EPERM`; escalated build succeeds.
- No separate internal editor route currently exists in `src/app`; editor code remains in the codebase but is no longer exposed via `/`.

## Update 2026-04-18 (production public page persistence via Supabase)

### Changed files
- `src/lib/server/public-pages-store.ts`
- `src/app/api/public-pages/[slug]/route.ts`
- `src/components/public/public-profile-page-client.tsx`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Replaced production public-page persistence backend with Supabase-backed storage (server-side) while preserving API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/public-pages/[slug]`
  - `PUT /api/public-pages/[slug]`
  - `DELETE /api/public-pages/[slug]`
- Superseded by the stricter update below: public-page persistence is now Supabase-only (no public localStorage fallback).
- Admin autosave/publish flow remains the same and continues publishing via `PUT /api/public-pages/[slug]`.

### Env setup
- Added required server env:
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Existing env still required:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (unchanged; still used by client-side Supabase code paths)
- Recommended Supabase table schema:
  - table name: `public_pages`
  - columns:
    - `slug text primary key`
    - `data jsonb not null`
    - `updated_at timestamptz not null default now()`
  - optional index:
    - `create index if not exists public_pages_updated_at_idx on public_pages (updated_at desc);`

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

### Known issues
- In this environment, non-escalated production build can fail with `spawn EPERM`; escalated build succeeds.
- Supabase table must exist and service role key must be present in production env, or public page API will return server errors by design.

## Update 2026-04-18 (strict Supabase public-page persistence)

### Changed files
- `src/lib/server/public-pages-store.ts`
- `src/components/public/public-profile-page-client.tsx`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Public page persistence now uses Supabase only for API-backed public data:
  - `GET /api/public-pages/[slug]`
  - `PUT /api/public-pages/[slug]`
  - `DELETE /api/public-pages/[slug]`
- Removed public page fallback to localStorage in `PublicProfilePageClient`; public slug pages now depend on API/Supabase data for cross-device consistency.
- Admin save/autosave flow remains unchanged and still publishes to `/api/public-pages/[slug]`, which persists to Supabase.
- Support form logic and Google Sheets deposit/withdraw flow are unchanged.

### Env setup (required)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

### SQL / schema setup
Run in Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
create table if not exists public.public_pages (
  slug text primary key,
  data jsonb not null,
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

create index if not exists public_pages_updated_at_idx
  on public.public_pages (updated_at desc);
```

Optional but recommended trigger to keep `updated_at` fresh on updates:

```sql
create or replace function public.set_updated_at()
returns trigger
language plpgsql
as $$
begin
  new.updated_at = now();
  return new;
end;
$$;

drop trigger if exists set_public_pages_updated_at on public.public_pages;
create trigger set_public_pages_updated_at
before update on public.public_pages
for each row
execute function public.set_updated_at();
```

RLS note:
- If RLS is enabled on `public.public_pages`, add policies that allow the service role to read/write rows. The API uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

### Known issues
- In this environment, non-escalated production build can fail with `spawn EPERM`; escalated build succeeds.
- Missing Supabase env or missing `public.public_pages` table will cause public page API requests to fail.

## Update 2026-04-18 (Supabase envs from .env.local active)

### Changed files
- `src/lib/server/public-pages-store.ts`
- `src/app/api/public-pages/[slug]/route.ts`
- `src/components/public/public-profile-page-client.tsx`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Public page API persistence is Supabase-backed using configured envs:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- Public API shape is preserved:
  - `GET /api/public-pages/[slug]`
  - `PUT /api/public-pages/[slug]`
  - `DELETE /api/public-pages/[slug]`
- Admin save/autosave continues publishing through `PUT /api/public-pages/[slug]`, now persisting to Supabase.
- Public slug rendering no longer depends on localStorage fallback; cross-device reads come from API/Supabase.
- Support form logic and Google Sheets deposit/withdraw flow remain unchanged.

### SQL / schema setup
```sql
create table if not exists public.public_pages (
  slug text primary key,
  data jsonb not null,
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

create index if not exists public_pages_updated_at_idx
  on public.public_pages (updated_at desc);
```

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

### Known issues
- In this environment, non-escalated production build can fail with `spawn EPERM`; escalated build succeeds.
- If Supabase table/schema is missing, public page API will fail until the SQL setup is applied.

## Update 2026-04-18 (dedicated admin route)

### Changed files
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Added dedicated production editor route at `/admin`.
- `/admin` now renders existing `AdminShell` directly.
- Root route `/` remains unchanged and still redirects to `/110`.
- No changes made to support form logic, Google Sheets deposit/withdraw flow, public page Supabase persistence, save/reset/restore behavior, or autosave logic.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

### Known issues
- In this environment, non-escalated production build can fail with `spawn EPERM`; escalated build succeeds.
- Public page `/110` still requires a published row in Supabase (`public.public_pages`) to render content.

## Update 2026-04-18 (public pages list export fix)

### Changed files
- `src/lib/server/public-pages-store.ts`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Added and exported `listPublicPages` in server store.
- `listPublicPages` now reads from Supabase `public.public_pages` via admin client and returns rows for API list responses.
- Returned fields include at least:
  - `slug`
  - `updated_at` (when present)
  - `data` (kept for existing My Pages UI compatibility)
- Existing exports remain unchanged:
  - `getPublicPageBySlug`
  - `upsertPublicPage`
  - `removePublicPageBySlug`
- No changes made to support form logic, Google Sheets flow, `/` redirect behavior, or `/admin` route.

## Update 2026-04-18 (atomic admin load + simple admin login guard)

### Changed files
- `src/components/admin/admin-shell.tsx`
- `src/components/admin/save-status-bar.tsx`
- `src/lib/server/admin-auth.ts`
- `src/proxy.ts`
- `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx`
- `src/app/api/admin/login/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/logout/route.ts`
- `.env.example`
- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Improved admin page switching hydration to avoid stale editor form values:
  - Added `workspaceHydrationKey` and remount keyed editor/preview only after hydration completes.
  - Ensures full form subtree reset after page switch so section-local form state does not leak across pages.
  - Keeps autosave/save blocked during switching and resumes after completion.
- Added simple `/admin` protection with password login:
  - Added `src/proxy.ts` (Next.js Proxy) to protect `/admin` and `/admin/*`.
  - Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/admin/login`.
  - Added `/admin/login` page and POST login/logout APIs.
  - Session uses httpOnly cookie (`linkbio_admin_session`) set server-side.
  - Password validation uses env `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (no hardcoded password in repo).
  - Added logout button in admin save/status bar.
- No changes to support forms, Google Sheets submission flow, or Supabase public page persistence.
- `/` redirect behavior and `/admin` editor route remain unchanged.

### Env setup
- Added:
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD=...`

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

### Notes on the stale-field bug
- Root cause matched section-local form state (`react-hook-form` default values and local component state) surviving the wrong render timing during slug switch.
- Current fix forces full section subtree remount after final hydration commit, which resets local/uncontrolled states per loaded page.
- Terminal run cannot perform browser click-through E2E, but the load mechanism is now keyed to hydration completion (`workspaceHydrationKey`) to support A -> B -> A transitions without stale fields.

## Update 2026-04-18 (separate route slug from public handle)

### Changed files
- `src/features/builder/types.ts`
- `src/features/builder/schema.ts`
- `src/features/builder/mock-data.ts`

### Behavior change
- Separated route slug from profile display handle:
  - Route/workspace slug remains `header.username` and is controlled by workspace actions (create/duplicate/load/switch).
  - New display handle field is `header.publicUsername` (fallback to `header.username` for legacy data).
- Header form behavior:
  - Slug shown as read-only in editor.
  - Editable field now targets Public Username / Handle.
  - Display name remains the large title as before.
- Public/admin preview behavior:
  - `@handle` now renders from `publicUsername` with fallback to legacy `username`.
  - Title mode `username` now means public handle.
- Support form submit slug source:
  - Uses route slug passed from page/workspace context, not mutable profile handle.
  - Prevents handle edits from changing support submit route identity.
- Added migration-safe normalization:
  - Legacy pages missing `publicUsername` are normalized to `publicUsername = username` during load/hydration paths.
  - Existing saved pages remain readable without schema-breaking changes.

### Unchanged
- Support forms logic/behavior remains unchanged.
- Google Sheets flow remains unchanged.
- Supabase public page persistence remains unchanged.
- Admin login guard/proxy remains unchanged.
- `/` redirect and `/admin` route behavior remain unchanged.

### Lint result
- `npm run lint`: PASS

### Build result
- `npm run build`: PASS (after escalated rerun)
- Non-escalated build in this environment still hits sandbox `spawn EPERM`.

- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Editor terminology aligned to match slug/handle separation requirements:
  - Header field label updated from mixed username wording to `Public Handle`.
  - Slug remains shown separately as route/workspace identity (read-only flow unchanged).
- No logic changes to support forms, Google Sheets flow, Supabase persistence, or admin login guard.

- `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md`

### Behavior change
- Normalized header display identity to `publicHandle` while keeping route identity on `username` (slug).
- Editor header field now writes to `publicHandle`; slug remains read-only in editor and controlled by create/duplicate/load workspace flows.
- Public/profile rendering now uses `@publicHandle` (with compatibility fallback chain):
  - `publicHandle`
  - legacy `publicUsername`
  - legacy `username`
- Save/hydration normalization now preserves slug in `header.username` and maps display-handle to `header.publicHandle`.
- Backward compatibility retained for old saved payloads containing `publicUsername` or only `username`.

### Unchanged
- Support forms flow unchanged.
- Google Sheets flow unchanged.
- Supabase public page persistence unchanged.
- Admin login guard/proxy unchanged.
